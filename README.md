# ChatbotHPU

Development of a video-based chatbot, which can be implemented into the website via widget. The chatbot is created on a free No-Code / Low-Code Tool.

1. Development of the chatbot:
 
 - Writing of the script, which the user goes through to get to his answer / covering all problems and questions from the FAQs
 - Recording of videos, which interactively guides the website visitor to the right answer to his problem 
 - Customize look and feel of the chatbot on the website (optimize UI)
 - Set rules and triggers (Set widget on specific pages, optimize UX)

--> the optimization and development of the chatbot takes place with a free no-code/low-code software and not in GitHub

2. Development of the website:

- Recreate the current Office of Hawaiian Affairs website

3. Implementing the chatbot:

- Finalize the prototype of how it could be implemented and would look on the current website
